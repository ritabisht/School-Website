        <p style="font-size: 22px;text-align: justify;">Education, in the largest sense, is any act or experience that has a formative effect on the mind, character or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills and values from one generation to another. Education facilitates development of the brain,maturing a young adult into an able, dependent adult. Education is a tool that so many people lack and such people end up regretting not having acquired it. School provides a place to acquire education as well as to push yourself to see your full potential. School also is a place where hard work pays off and it is evident in grades Our school has an extremely unswerving, devoted and qualified faculty that constantly strives to make learning a pleasurable experience for children. As a parent, you want the best for your child and we are proud to be working with you to ensure that they are given the right knowledge to face future challenges. I would like to acknowledge the role being played by the committed and dedicated team of our teachers. We hope to create an atmosphere of reverence for education and a healthy environment where work, sports and co-curricular activities will mould our students and spur them on to be the brightest and the best. Discipline, courage and perseverance are instilled among the children through a wide range of games and sports activities based on their needs and interests. Competitive sports, which are an integral part of the school curriculum, not only motivate the children but also help in developing sportsmanship, tolerance and teamwork. Students learn the value of work ethic and responsibility. The curriculum of our school is research oriented and based on teamwork vis-à-vis discussions, group project work, discovery and exploration. Various combinations of subjects are offered so that students can pursue their desired courses of study later in life. A school Magazine is a mirror and index of the activities of an Institution and all round development of the students.Every year, we get the school magazine ( VIDYA DEEP) published, and the same is distributed to all the students without taking any extra charge from them. The doors of the School are always open for the students and their parents for any suggestion or guidance.

        <p style="font-size: 22px;text-align: justify;">HRSSSS, Dilshad Garden is pleased to announce its new website. It will serve as our main communication tool with our parents and students. I am indeed delighted to express my inner most feelings as I witness my dream in a beautiful shape in the form of a leading Educational institution of East Delhi. HRSSSS with strength of more than 2500 students is academically well poised with all educational techniques and practices. At HRSSSS, our focus is on making learning at School more meaningful. The School's curricular framework encourages thinking, guides children continuously to engage in inquiry, reflection, communication and application of their learning in different situations. Teaching and learning are the two sides of a coin. The most accepted criterion for measuring good teaching is the amount of student learning that occurs. Education is the manifestation of perfection already in man" – (Swami Vivekananda) The purpose of education is not just making a student literate but adds rationale thinking, knowledgeablity and self sufficiency. It is an integral part of their growth and helps them become good citizens. Education is an engine for the growth and progress of any society. We in our school are taking care each and every child. We are providing best facilities and atmosphere to our students for their mental and academic growth. A lot of activities are being increased day by day to make the teaching and learning interesting. Introduction of smart classes have added a lot in this motto. New courses are added every year keeping the interest and the future of the children in our mind.</p>
