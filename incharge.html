        <h3><u>The Secondry Incharge Desk(Geeta Mahajan)</u></h3>
        <p>Education is a step today for a better and a resourceful tomorrow. To be educated is being synonymous to being respected. Education makes people easy to lead but difficult to drive, easy to govern but impossible to enslave. Education is important for everyone because it empowers people with knowledge, skills and self confidence which are necessary to participate fully in the development process. Our school has adopted CCE system this year, which helps in improving student's performance by identifying his / her learning difficulties at regular time intervals, right from the beginning of the academic session and implying suitable remedial measures for enhancing their learning performance. As a part of this new system, student's marks are replaced by grades which are evaluated through a series of curricular and extracurricular activities. Academic grades are also awarded to students based on work experience skills, innovation team work, behavior etc. to evaluate and present an overall measure of the student's ability. I have spent my formative years under the mantle of loving care of Hans Raj Smarak School. I have learnt the most valuable lessons of my life from my seniors and colleagues. Being a part of this school, I feel fortunate and proud. I hope and pray that our school may continue to rise with the same gusto with student ever alive and vibrant and ready to make the world a better place.

        <h3><u>The Middle Incharge Desk (Ritu Mahajan)</u></h3>
        <p>Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another. Instruction ends in the school-room, but education ends only with life. The children face the period of physical and psychological development from the onset of puberty to maturity. This is the age of learning as in this age logical reasoning in the child has been developed to make the concept clearer. We have to fill the positive attitude in this age of the students as in the previous years they learn the basics but now they are in the age of logic reasoning. Time is fast changing; there is competition in every field, so make silage, while the sun shines. Set your aim and preferences in right and struggle hard to attain, these. Don't get discouraged by your failures or get overconfident by your successes. In today's highly competitive society, one may find himself very hard pressed and overburdened, hence to cope with challenges of life, it is compulsory to widen the right habits and attitudes. Building such an attitude will help achieve success in both personal and professional front. The optimistic attitude gives self-assurance, enhances your wisdom of safety and creates benevolence and agreement; so start on today to deliberately change negative thoughts. Remember the three C's - commitment, control and challenge. Make a positive obligation to yourself, keep your mind under control and face the challenges cheerfully. For me here at Hans Raj ,every child has the potential to change the world in his own way and that is why each child is unique. The world belongs to them and we are mere custodians. Let's nurture our children, God's most precious gift to us to care for others and share the bounty of Mother Nature.

        <h3><u>The Pre-Primary & Primary Incharge Desk (Indu Vohra)</u></h3>
        <p>"Education gives children a love of learning than encourages them to improve their minds over a lifetime." "A place where young plants & trees are grown up for sale or planting elsewhere." "A school for children between 3 to 5 years of age." "A room in a house set apart for young children." The above definitions give a clear indications that Pre-school education wherin children between 3 and 5 years are admitted, placed and educated in the environments which are most appropriate,suitable and congenial for laying in the roots of strong foundation for growth of a childThe tender age of 3 to 5 years during which the children are admitted to this system of education, is an age during which the children's total structure and personality can be changed and developed as per the linking and desires of parents and teachers as well. To have the best plants which grow into strong, beautiful and fruitful trees, the quality of seeds, soil, manure;, fertilizer, water and time management are all very important, beside the quality of hard work and experience of Gardener who takes charges of the plants 7 trees.Same is the case of young children, where we have to ensure that the atmosphere, surroundings and ambience of the pre-school and of the school are appropriate. The gadgets with which the children are playing or being educated are modern and of utmost top quality. A Teacher's training, experience and the methods are important but the most important is the Confident Relationship between tender kids & their teacher. This relationship which inculcates the values & habits in young minds, lays the best foundation for child and paves ways for him to be more strong, understanding, social and able to face the challenges of life. Pre-primary and Primary education has come to stay as an important and integral part of our present day education system. With the advent of newer techniques and fast changing advanced technologies, Our education system has undergo a vast change and will keep the pace, always. After all, we want future generations to be smart, strong and caring for the society and this can be achieved under the able hands of 'Guru"

        <h3><u>The Examination Incharge Desk (Meenakshi Tandon)</u></h3>
        <p>Examination is a formal test of a person's knowledge or proficiency in a subject or skill.." The examinations' being a very sensitive and time bound task is carried out by the following steps: Secrecy, Conduction and Evaluation process on one side and Assessments-FAs, SAs' on the other. These different processes work in a very cordial manner having committed and dedicated exam cell team under the supervision of examination incharge with their given duties and responsibilities. I am thankful to School Management to give me the additional responsibility as Incharge of Examinations of this great seat of learning. With the blessing and support from my staff, we are completing our promises. Ancient teaching holds relevance even today but to keep pace with changing time, increasing number of candidates, expanding workloads, and shortening delivery time, the school is adopting software to generate result grade cards under CCE. I take this opportunity to convey my best wishes to all students appearing in various forthcoming examinations of this academic session. Close INCH
